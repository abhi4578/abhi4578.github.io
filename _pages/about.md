Hi, I am Abhilash Venkatesh, currently an OMSCS graduate. I previously worked 
as Devops Engineer at [CDPG](https://dataforpublicgood.org.in/)(formerly [IUDX](https://iudx.org.in)).
I love Linux, FOSS, systems, security and privacy! 

Through this personal website, just want to add my writings on tech, MS,
have a basic portfolio, projects, homelab, meetups conference notes and talks.
