Hi, I am Abhilash Venkatesh, currently an OMSCS graduate. I previously worked 
as Devops Engineer at [CDPG](https://dataforpublicgood.org.in/)(formerly [IUDX](https://iudx.org.in)).

I love Linux, FOSS, systems, security and privacy! 

Through this personal website, just want to add my writings on tech, MS,
portfolio, projects, homelab, meetups conference notes, learnings and talks
etc at one place.
