Hi, I am Abhilash Venkatesh, currently an OMSCS graduate. I previously worked as DevOps Engineer at [CDPG](https://dataforpublicgood.org.in/)(formerly [IUDX](https://iudx.org.in)).
I did my undergraduate from NITK, Surathkal in Information Technology. You can find an overview of my experiences here: [Resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhi4578/Resume/refs/heads/main/Resume.pdf)

I love Linux, FOSS, systems, security and privacy!

Through this personal website, want to add my writings on tech, MS,
portfolio, projects, homelab, meetups conference notes, learnings and talks
etc. at one place. I love quotes, and I am maintaining list of quotes at this [repo](https://github.com/abhi4578/quotes) and randomly a quote is selected from this list and rendered on left side column.
